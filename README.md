# About

Built on top of [node-postgres] and its connection pool, this library translates their callback interface into one based on [Promises/A+],
while extending the protocol to a higher level, with automated connections and transactions management.

In addition, the library provides:

* its own, more flexible query formatting;
* complete event reporting for connectivity, errors, queries and transactions;
* declarative approach to controlling query results;
* support for all popular promise libraries.

# Installing
```
$ npm install pg-promise
```

# Testing
* Install project dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```
* Make sure the tests can connect to your local test database, according to connection details in [test/db/header.js](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise/blob/master/test/db/header.js).
Either match your database configuration or change the connection details in that file.

* Initialize the database with some test data:
```
$ node test/db/init.js
```
* Run tests:
```
$ make test
```
On Windows you can also run tests with `test.bat`

# Getting started

## 1. Loading
```javascript
// Loading the library:
var pgpLib = require('pg-promise');
```
## 2. Initializing
```javascript
// Initializing the library, with optional global settings:
var pgp = pgpLib(/*options*/);
```
You can pass additional `options` parameter when initializing the library (see chapter [Initialization Options](#advanced) for details).

## 3. Connecting
Use one of the two ways to specify database connection details:
* Configuration Object:
```javascript
var cn = {
    host: 'localhost', // server name or IP address;
    port: 5432,
    database: 'my_db_name',
    user: 'user_name',
    password: 'user_password'
};
```
* Connection String:
```javascript
var cn = "postgres://username:password@host:port/database";
```
This library doesn't use any of the connection's details, it simply passes them on to [PG] when opening a new connection.
For more details see pg connection parameters in [WiKi](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki/pg#parameters) and
[implementation](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/blob/master/lib/connection-parameters.js).

## 4. Database Instance
```javascript
var db = pgp(cn); // create a new database instance from the connection details
```
There can be multiple database objects instantiated in the application from different connection details.

To get started quickly, see our [Learn by Example](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise/wiki/Learn-by-Example) tutorial. 

# Usage

The library supports promise-chained queries on shared and detached connections.
Choosing which one you want depends on the situation and personal preferences.

## Detached Connections

Queries in a detached promise chain maintain connection independently, they each acquire a connection from the pool,
execute the query and then release the connection.
```javascript
db.one("select * from users where id=$1", 123) // find the user from id;
    .then(function(data){
        // find 'login' records for the user found:
        return db.query("select * from audit where event=$1 and userId=$2",
            ["login", data.id]);
    })
    .then(function(data){
        // display found audit records;
        console.log(data);
    }, function(reason){
        console.log(reason); // display reason why the call failed;
    })
```
In a situation where a single request is to be made against the database, a detached chain is the only one that makes sense.
And even if you intend to execute multiple queries in a chain, keep in mind that even though each will use its own connection,
such will be used from a connection pool, so effectively you end up with the same connection, without any performance penalty.

## Shared Connections

A promise chain with a shared connection always starts with `connect()`, which allocates a connection that's shared with all the
query requests down the promise chain. The connection must be released when no longer needed.

```javascript
var sco; // shared connection object;
db.connect()
    .then(function(obj){
        sco = obj; // save the connection object;
        // find active users created before today:
        return sco.query("select * from users where active=$1 and created < $2::date",
            [true, new Date()]);
    })
    .then(function(data){
        console.log(data); // display all the user details;
    }, function(reason){
        console.log(reason); // display reason why the call failed;
    })
    .done(function(){
        if(sco){
            sco.done(); // release the connection, if it was successful;
        }
    });
```
Shared-connection chaining is for those who want absolute control over connection, either because they want to execute lots of queries in one go,
or because they like squeezing every bit of performance out of their code. Other than, the author hasn't seen any real performance difference
from the detached-connection chaining.

## Transactions

Transactions can be executed within both shared and detached promise chains in the same way, performing the following actions:

1. Acquires a new connection (detached chains only);
2. Executes `BEGIN` command;
3. Invokes your callback function with the connection object;
4. Executes `COMMIT`, if the callback resolves, or `ROLLBACK`, if the callback rejects;
5. Releases the connection (detached chains only);
6. Resolves with the callback result, if success; rejects with the reason, if failed.

#### Detached Transactions

```javascript
var promise = require('promise'); // or any other supported promise library;
db.tx(function(t){

    // creating a sequence of transaction queries:
    var q1 = t.none("update users set active=$1 where id=$2", [true, 123]);
    var q2 = t.one("insert into audit(entity, id) values($1, $2) returning id",
        ['users', 123]);

    // returning a promise that determines a successful transaction:
    return promise.all([q1, q2]); // all of the queries are to be resolved

}).then(function(data){
    console.log(data); // printing successful transaction output
}, function(reason){
    console.log(reason); // printing the reason why the transaction was rejected
});
```
A detached transaction acquires a connection and exposes object `t` to let all containing queries execute on the same connection.

#### Shared-connection Transactions

When executing a transaction within a shared connection chain, parameter `t` represents the same connection as `sco` from opening a shared connection, so either one can be used inside such a transaction interchangeably.

```javascript
var promise = require('promise'); // or any other supported promise library;
var sco; // shared connection object;
db.connect()
    .then(function(obj){
        sco = obj;
        return sco.oneOrNone("select * from users where active=$1 and id=$1", [true, 123]);
    })
    .then(function(data){
        return sco.tx(function(t){

            // Since it is a transaction within a shared chain, it doesn't matter whether
            // the two calls below use object `t` or `sco`, as they are exactly the same:
            var q1 = t.none("update users set active=$1 where id=$2", [false, data.id]);
            var q2 = sco.one("insert into audit(entity, id) values($1, $2) returning id",
                ['users', 123]);

            // returning a promise that determines a successful transaction:
            return promise.all([q1, q2]); // all of the queries are to be resolved;
        });
    }, function(reason){
        console.log(reason); // printing the reason why the transaction was rejected;
    })
    .done(function(){
        if(sco){
            sco.done(); // release the connection, if it was successful;
        }
    });
```
If you need to execute just one transaction, the detached transaction pattern is all you need.
But even if you need to combine it with other queries in then a detached chain, it will work just as fine.
As stated earlier, choosing a shared chain over a detached one is mostly a matter of special requirements and/or personal preference.

#### Nested Transactions

Similar to the shared-connection transactions, nested transactions automatically share the connection between all levels.
This library sets no limitation as to the depth (nesting levels) of transactions supported.

Example:

```javascript
db.tx(function (t) {
    var queries = [
        t.none("drop table users;"),
        t.none("create table users(id serial not null, name text not null)")
    ];
    for (var i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
        queries.push(t.none("insert into users(name) values($1)", "name-" + i));
    }
    queries.push(
        t.tx(function () {
            return t.tx(function(){
                return t.one("select count(*) from users");
            });
        }));
    return promise.all(queries);
})
.then(function (data) {
    console.log(data); // printing transaction result;
}, function (reason) {
    console.log(reason); // printing why the transaction failed;
})
```

Things to note from the example above:
* Sub-transactions do not declare a context parameter in their callback. It is not because
they don't receive one, they all do, but they don't care in such situation because of the shared connection
chain that will result in the same `t` object as for the main callback, so they just reuse it from the parent,
for simplicity;
* A nested transaction cannot be disconnected from its container, i.e. it must get into the container's promise chain,
 or it will result in an attempt to execute against an unknown connection;
* As expected, a failure on any level in a nested transaction will `ROLLBACK` and `reject` the entire chain.

#### Transactions with SAVEPOINT

`SAVEPOINT` in PostgreSQL caters for advanced transaction scenarios where partial `ROLLBACK` can be executed,
depending on the logic of the transaction.

Unfortunately, this doesn't go along with the [Promises/A+] architecture that doesn't support partial `reject`.

The only work-around via promises is to strip a transaction into individual commands and execute them as a promise
chain within a shared connection. The example below shows how this can be done.

```javascript
var sco; // shared connection object;
var txErr; // transaction error;
var txData; // transaction data;
db.connect()
    .then(function (obj) {
        sco = obj; // save the connection object;
        return promise.all([
            sco.none('begin'),
            sco.none('update users set name=$1 where id=$2', ['changed1', 1]),
            sco.none('savepoint first'), // creating savepoint;
            sco.none('update users set name=$1 where id=$2', ['changed2', 2]),
            sco.none('rollback to first') // reverting to the savepoint;
        ])
            .then(function (data) {
                txData = data; // save the transaction output data;
                return sco.none('commit'); // persist changes;
            }, function (reason) {
                txErr = reason; // save the transaction failure reason;
                return sco.none('rollback'); // revert changes;
            });
    })
    .then(function () {
        if (txErr) {
            console.log('Rollback Reason: ' + txErr);
        } else {
            console.log(txData); // successful transaction output;
        }
    }, function (reason) {
        console.log(reason); // connection issue;
    })
    .done(function () {
        if (sco) {
            sco.done(); // release the connection, if it was successful;
        }
    });
```

The issue with stripping out a transaction like this and injecting `SAVEPOINT` - it gets much more
complicated to control the result of individual commands within a transaction, you may need to check every
result and change the following commands accordingly. This is why it makes much more sense to do such
transactions inside SQL functions, and not on the client side.

## Queries and Parameters

Every connection context of the library shares the same query protocol, starting with generic method `query`,
that's defined as shown below:
```javascript
function query(query, values, qrm);
```
* `query` (required) - query string that supports two types of formatting, depending on the `values` passed:
   - format `$1, $2`, if `values` is simple (text, boolean, number, date or null) or an array of values;
   - format `${propName}`, if `values` is an object (not null and not Date);
* `values` (optional) - value/array/object to replace the variables in the query;
* `qrm` - (optional) Query Result Mask, as explained below...

When a value/property inside array/object is of type array, it is treated as a [PostgreSQL Array Type](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/arrays.html),
converted into the array constructor format of `array[]`, the same as calling method `as.array()`.

Examples:
```javascript
console.log(pgp.as.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, null]]));
// will print: array[[1,2,3],[4,5,null]]

console.log(pgp.as.array([['one', 'two'], [undefined, 'four']]));
// will print: array[['one','two'],[null,'four']]

console.log(pgp.as.array([[1, 2], ['three', 'four']]));
// will print: array[[1,2],['three','four']],
// but executing it within a query will throw an error
// due to heterogeneous data type in the array.
```

When a value/property inside array/object is of type `object` (except for `null` and `Date`), it is automatically
serialized into JSON, the same as calling method `as.json()`, except the latter would convert anything to JSON.

Raw text values can be injected by using variable name appended with symbol `^`:
`$1^, $2^, etc...` or `${varName^}`.
Raw text is injected without any pre-processing, which means:
* No replacing each single-quote symbol `'` with two;
* No wrapping text into single quotes.

This is to allow for special-case variable formatting, like in the following examples:

```javascript
// injecting "John" name without quotes:
query("...WHERE name LIKE '%$1^%'", "John");

// injecting value of property 'name' without quotes:
query("...WHERE name LIKE '%${name^}%'", {name: "John"});

// injecting a CSV-formatted text without quotes:
query("...WHERE id IN($1^)", pgp.as.csv([1,2,3,4])); 
```

In order to eliminate the chances of unexpected query results and make code more robust, each request supports
parameter `qrm` (Query Result Mask), via type `queryResult`:
```javascript
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Query Result Mask flags;
//
// Any combination is supported, except for one + many.
queryResult = {
    one: 1,     // single-row result is expected;
    many: 2,    // multi-row result is expected;
    none: 4,    // no rows expected;
    any: 6,      // (default) = many|none = any result.
    passthru: 8  // return original pg result
};
```

In the following generic-query example we indicate that the call can return anything:
```javascript
db.query("select * from users");
```
which is equivalent to calling either one of the following:
```javascript
db.query("select * from users", undefined, queryResult.many | queryResult.none);
db.query("select * from users", undefined, queryResult.any);
db.manyOrNone("select * from users");
db.any("select * from users");
```

This usage pattern is facilitated through result-specific methods that can be used instead of the generic query:
```javascript
db.many(query, values); // expects one or more rows
db.one(query, values); // expects single row
db.none(query, values); // expects no rows
db.any(query, values); // expects anything, same as `manyOrNone`
db.oneOrNone(query, values); // expects 1 or 0 rows
db.manyOrNone(query, values); // expects anything, same as `any`
db.passthru(query, values); // returns original pg result
```
You can add your own methods to this protocol via the [extend](#extend) event.  

Each query function resolves its **data** object according to the `qrm` that was used:

* `none` - **data** is `null`. If the query returns any kind of data, it is rejected.
* `one` - **data** is a single object. If the query returns no data or more than one row of data, it is rejected.
* `many` - **data** is an array of objects. If the query returns no rows, it is rejected.
* `one` | `none` - **data** is `null`, if no data was returned; or a single object, if there was one row of data returned.
* `passthru` - ***data** is always `result` object returned by the pg library. No checks or modifications are done.

If the query returns more than one row of data, the query is rejected.
* `many` | `none` - **data** is an array of objects. When no rows are returned, **data** is an empty array.

If you try to specify `one` | `many` in the same query, such query will be rejected without executing it, telling you that such mask is not valid.

If `qrm` is not specified when calling generic `query` method, it is assumed to be `many` | `none`, i.e. any kind of data expected.

> This is all about writing robust code, when the client specifies what kind of data it is ready to handle on the declarative level,
leaving the burden of all extra checks to the library.

## Named Parameters

The library supports named parameters in query formatting, with the ES6-like syntax of `${propName}`:

```javascript
db.query("select * from users where name=${name} and active=${active}", {
    name: 'John',
    active: true
});
```
The same goes for all types of query methods as well as method `as.format(query, values)`, where `values`
now can also be an object whose properties can be referred to by name from within the query.

Since all variables in this case are property names of the object-parameter, standard javascript
variable naming convention applies here:

* a valid variable starts with a letter, underscore or `$` symbol, followed by any combination
of letters, digits, underscores and `$`;
* leading and trailing white spaces surrounding variables are ignored;
* variable names are case-sensitive.

It is important to know that while property values `null` and `undefined` are both formatted as `null`,
an error is thrown when the property doesn't exist at all.

## Functions and Procedures
In PostgreSQL stored procedures are just functions that usually do not return anything.

Suppose we want to call function **findAudit** to find audit records by **user id** and maximum timestamp.
We can make such call as shown below:

```javascript
db.func('findAudit', [123, new Date()])
    .then(function(data){
        console.log(data); // printing the data returned
    }, function(reason){
        console.log(reason); // printing the reason why the call was rejected
    });
```

We passed it **user id** = 123, plus current Date/Time as the timestamp. We assume that the function signature matches
the parameters that we passed. All values passed are serialized automatically to comply with PostgreSQL type formats.

Method `func` accepts optional third parameter - `qrm` (Query Result Mask), the same as method `query`.

And when you are not expecting any return results, call `db.proc` instead. Both methods return a [Promise] object,
but `db.proc` doesn't take a `qrm` parameter, always assuming it is `one`|`none`.

Summary for supporting procedures and functions:

```javascript
db.func(query, values, qrm); // expects the result according to `qrm`
db.proc(query, values); // calls db.func(query, values, queryResult.one | queryResult.none)
```

## Conversion Helpers

The library provides several helper functions to convert javascript types into their proper PostgreSQL presentation that can be passed
directly into queries or functions as parameters. All of such helper functions are located within namespace `pgp.as`, and each function
returns a formatted string when successful or throws an error when it fails.

```javascript
pgp.as.bool(value); // converts value into PostgreSQL boolean presentation;

pgp.as.number(value);
                    // converts value into PostgreSQL number presentation,
                    // with support for NaN, +Infinity and -Infinity;

pgp.as.text(value, raw);
                    // converts value into PostgreSQL text presentation,
                    // fixing single-quote symbols and wrapping the result
                    // in quotes (unless flag 'raw' is set);

pgp.as.date(value, raw);
                    // converts value into PostgreSQL date/time presentation,
                    // wrapped in quotes (unless flag 'raw' is set);

pgp.as.json(value, raw);
                    // converts any value into JSON (using JSON.stringify),
                    // then fixes single-quote symbols and wraps it up in
                    // single quotes (unless flag 'raw' is set);

pgp.as.array(array); // converts array into PostgreSQL Array Type constructor
                     // string: array[]

pgp.as.csv(array);  // returns a CSV string with values formatted according
                    // to their type, using the above methods;

pgp.as.format(query, values);
            // replaces variables in the query with their `values` as specified;
            // `values` can be a simple value, an array or an object.
```

For methods which take optional flag `raw` it is to indicate that the
return text is to be without any pre-processing:
* No replacing each single-quote symbol `'` with two;
* No wrapping text into single quotes;
* Throwing an error when the variable value is `null` or `undefined`.
This adheres to the query formatting, as well as method `as.format` when variable
names are appended with symbol `^`: `$1^, $2^, etc...` or `${varName^}`.

As none of these helpers are associated with any database, they can be used from anywhere.

There are some cases where you might want to use a combination of these methods instead
of the implicit parameter formatting through query methods. For example, if you want to
generate a filter string to be used where applicable, you might use a code like this:

```javascript
function createFilter(filter){
    var cnd = []; // conditions;
    if(filter.start){
        // add start date condition;
        cnd.push(pgp.as.format("start >= $1::date", filter.start));
    }
    if(filter.end){
        // add end date condition;
        cnd.push(pgp.as.format("end <= $1::date", filter.end));
    }
    if(filter.active !== undefined){
        // add active flag;
        cnd.push(pgp.as.format("active = $1", filter.active));
    }
    if(filter.name){
        // add name-like condition with a raw-text variable
        // by appending '^' to its name;
        cnd.push(pgp.format("name like '%$1^%'", filter.name));
    }
    return cnd.join(" and "); // returning the complete filter string;
}
```

# Advanced

## Initialization Options

When initializing the library, you can pass object `options` with a set of global properties:
```javascript
var options = {
    // pgFormatting - redirects query formatting to PG;
    // promiseLib - overrides default promise library;
    // connect - database 'connect' notification;
    // disconnect - database 'disconnect' notification;
    // query - query execution notification;
    // transact - transaction notification;
    // error - error notification;
    // extend - protocol extension event;
};
var pgp = pgpLib(options);
```

#### pgFormatting

By default, **pg-promise** provides its own implementation of the query formatting,
supporting two different formats:

* Format `$1, $2, etc`, when parameter `values` is either a single value or an array of values;
* Format `${propName}` - ES6-like format, if `values` is an object that's not `null`
and not a `Date` instance.

Every query method of the library accepts `values` as its second parameter.

**pg-promise** automatically converts all basic javascript types (text, boolean, date, number and null)
into their Postgres presentation.

In addition, the library can convert:
* array into [Postgres Array Types](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/arrays.html) constructor;
* an object inside array or an object property - into JSON string.

If, however, you want to use query formatting that's implemented by the [PG] library, set parameter `pgFormatting`
to be `true` when initializing the library, and every query formatting will redirect to the [PG]'s implementation.

Although this has a huge implication for the library's functionality, it is not within the scope of this project to detail.
For any further reference you should use documentation of the [PG] library.

**NOTE:** Formatting parameters for calling functions (methods `func` and `proc`) is not affected by this override.
When needed, use the generic `query` instead to invoke functions with redirected query formatting.

#### promiseLib

Set this property to an alternative promise library compliant with the [Promises/A+] standard.

By default, **pg-promise** uses version of [Promises/A+] provided by [Promise]. If you want to override
this and force the library to use a different implementation of the standard, just set this parameter
to the library's instance.

Example of switching over to [Bluebird]:
```javascript
var promise = require('bluebird');
var options = {
    promiseLib: promise
};
var pgp = pgpLib(options);
```

[Promises/A+] libraries that passed our compatibility test and are currently supported:

* [Promise] - used by default
* [Bluebird]
* [When]
* [Q]
* [RSVP] - doesn't have `done()`, use `finally/catch` instead
* [Lie] - doesn't have `done()`


Compatibility with other [Promises/A+] libraries though possible, is an unknown.

#### connect

Global notification function of acquiring a new database connection.
```javascript
var options = {
    connect: function(client){
        var cp = client.connectionParameters;
        console.log("Connected to database '" + cp.database + "'");
    }
};
```

The function takes only one parameter - `client` object from the [PG] library that represents connection
with the database.

**NOTE:** The library will throw an error instead of making the call, if `options.connect` is set to
a non-empty value other than a function.

---
#### disconnect

Global notification function of releasing a database connection.
```javascript
var options = {
    disconnect: function(client){
        var cp = client.connectionParameters;
        console.log("Disconnecting from database '" + cp.database + "'");
    }
};
```

The function takes only one parameter - `client` object from the [PG] library that represents the connection
that's being released.

**NOTE:** The library will throw an error instead of making the call, if `options.disconnect` is set to
a non-empty value other than a function.

---
#### query

Global notification of a query that's being executed.
```javascript
var options = {
    query: function (e) {
        console.log("Query: " + e.query);
        if (e.ctx) {
            // this query is executing inside a transaction,
            // and ctx contains all the relevant details;
        }
    }
};
```

Notification happens just before the query execution. And if the handler throws
an error, the query execution will be rejected with that error.

Parameter `e` is the event's context object that shares its format between events
`query`, `error` and `transact`. It supports the following properties:

* `client` - object from the [PG] library that represents the connection;
* `query` - input query string, if applicable; `undefined` otherwise;
* `params` - input query parameters, if applicable; `undefined` otherwise;
* `ctx` - transaction context object, if applicable; `undefined` otherwise;

A transaction context object (`ctx`) supports the following properties:
* `start` - start time of the transaction;
* `finish` - optional; finish time of the transaction, if it has finished;
* `tag` - optional; tag object/value passed into the transaction, if any;
* `success` - optional; indicates success for a finished transaction;
* `result` - optional; transaction result, if finished: data resolved by the transaction,
 if `success` is `true`, otherwise it is set to the `reason` that was passed
 when rejecting the transaction.

A transaction can be tagged when it is called using the following syntax:
```javascript
db.tx(tag, cb);
```
i.e. in front of the callback function you can inject a value or object that
tags the transaction, so it can be used as a reference when handling events.

All properties of `ctx` marked as optional are not set, unless they are relevant
to the event.

**NOTE:** The library will throw an error instead of making the call, if `options.query` is set to
a non-empty value other than a function.

---
#### error

Global notification of an error while executing a query or transaction.
```javascript
var options = {
    error: function (err, e) {
        console.log("Error: " + err);
        if (e.query) {
            console.log("Query: " + e.query);
            if (e.params) {
                console.log("Parameters: " + e.params);
            }
        }
        if (e.ctx) {
            // print transaction details;
        }
    }
};
```
For parameter `e` see documentation of the `query` event earlier.

The library will suppress any error thrown by the handler.

**NOTE:** The library will throw an error instead of making the call,
if `options.error` is set to a non-empty value other than a function.

---
#### transact

Global notification of a transaction start / finish events.
```javascript
var options = {
    transact: function (e) {
        console.log("Start Time: " + e.ctx.start);
        if (e.ctx.finish) {
            // this is a transaction `finish` event;
            console.log("Finish Time: " + e.ctx.finish);
            if (e.ctx.success) {
                // e.ctx.result = the data resolved;
            } else {
                // e.ctx.result = the rejection reason;
            }
        } else {
            // this is a transaction `start` event;
        }
    }
};
```

For parameter `e` see documentation of the `query` event earlier.

The library will suppress any error thrown by the handler.

**NOTE:** The library will throw an error instead of making the call, if `options.transact` is set to
a non-empty value other than a function.

---
#### extend

Override this event to extend the existing access layer with your own functions
and properties best suited for your application.

The extension thus becomes available across all access layers:

* Within the root/default database protocol;
* Inside transactions, including nested ones. 

In the example below we extend the protocol with function `addImage` that will insert
one binary image and resolve with the new record id:
```javascript
var options = {
    extend: function (obj) {
        obj.addImage = function (data) {
            return obj.one("insert into images(data) values($1) returning id",
                '\\x' + data);
        }
    }
};
```

IMPORTANT: Do not override any of the predefined functions or properties in the protocol,
as it will break your access object.

The library provides no error handling, should your `extend` function throw an error.

**NOTE:** The library will throw an error instead of making the call, if `options.extend` is set to
a non-empty value other than a function.

## Library de-initialization

When exiting your application, make the following call:
```javascript
pgp.end();
```
This will release pg connection pool globally and make sure that the process terminates without any delay.
If you do not call it, your process may be waiting for 30 seconds (default) or so, waiting for the pg connection pool to expire.
